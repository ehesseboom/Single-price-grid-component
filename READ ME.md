## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

There isn't a particular part of my html or css that I am extra proud of. I've used everything before. The idea for this challenge was to not use Google and figure everything out just by trying. This was hard, because I've used a lot of Google during coding with HTML/CSS. Well, eventually I had to use Google for one element, which was aria-label. I only knew about an alt tag for images and pictures. I used aria-label for the button in the solution to make it more accessible.

### Continued development

This project is the first time I used Andy Bell's CSS reset. I've had heard of it, but never actually start my CSS file with it. I will keep using this. Besides that I feel like overall I understand the basics of HTML/CSS and topics like Flexbox and Grid. I think for my next step I need to work on a project that requires more then the basics.

### Useful resources

- [CSS matic](https://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow) - I needed to use this tool for making box shadows on my container and button.
